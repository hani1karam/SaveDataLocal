 The keychain is a secure and encrypted storage place for sensitive data

to set:
        keychain.set(textField.text ?? "", forKey: "email")
to get:
        keychain.get("email")


# 3-coreData
* why?
to save your application's permanent data for offline use, to cache temporary data, and to add undo functionality to your app on a single device
* how?
to add data :
        dataManager?.addFavoritesItem(item: RecipeItemModel(id: "1",name: "Hany"))
to get data :
      dataManager?.fetchFavoritesListList()[0].name 
      
# 4-SQLITE
SQLite is a library that implements a lightweight database engine that is incredibly performant and, therefore, a great fit for embedded systems, such as mobile devices. Even though SQLite is advertised as a relational database, it is important to realize that the developer is in charge of maintaining the relationships between records stored in the database.


# 5- Realm
Realmâ€™s local database persists data on-disk, so apps work as well offline as they do online..
